This is the only HTML of this application.


In this application we have used an old way of including javascript, we
directly include the javascript code in this file.
The ordering of inclusion of javascript file is fundamental to keep
working this application.


In this version of the application there are a great quantities of comments
and there is also all the code of the debug interface.
So probably the version that is released must be cleaned at least from
the comments and the code from the debug interface.
This version is thinked only for developing purpose.


Now the shaders' code is loaded from different files thrugh a not really 
good way. Pratically all the shaders are loaded with fetch and await.
We can't load shaders like we normally load javascript files.
The only way is probably to create a sort of build system where this
files are appended to this file directly like a script block of code.
This is probably the best way to embed a configuration file in the
application.
